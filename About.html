              <p>
                I was born in Ghana to Mr. Ayikpa Albert and Mary Agbesi all of Blessed Memory. I have four Sisters and Myself, the only son.
                Life has not been fair and fun to me but I have vowed not to give up on myself. I see myself in the light and not the darkness.
                I str to live a decent and honest life as much as posiible. Want to tell a story oneday about the rough journey I have been on for years.
                It must be told that I have no basic knowledge of Computer until I came to Ghana but I badly want to be good in Computer programming and change
                the narrative that nothing is impossible in life though it might take a lot more than normal work and effort.
              </p>

                My family is such an important part of my life. They keep me going everyday. My children Lionel and Michelle are such a precious gift to me. Naomi my wife is such a great
                support to me. everything I do is for them. Regina my elder sister is such a great and strong person as well, Very fearless and keep dreaming high. Princess and Ruth
                are a bit far but I love them. Saviour our last born is beautiful and i hope she becomes a better person in this world.
              </p>

                I am a very positive thinker who feels anything is possible when we put our mind and focus to it. Growing up, I never got most of the Basic
                things of the world. I was born in a poor family where we never had even electricity to study. I used lanteen to study so i do not remain in poverty.
                I had to farm a little to buy textbooks when i got to senior high. without giving up, i worked hard and got to teacher training college. I later got
                out of college in 2012 when i got the opportunity to travel to America. I had always dreamed to get a degree and today, I feel proud of not giving up
                on my dream.
                My parents were so important to me but unfortunately, I lost them all. I wish they are still here to see and share in my dream and success.

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>My career vision is to become a data analyst and also build Databases for people, Institutions and companies.
            My dream as a human is to become someone that can inspire many and those who have given up in life. I want to inspire those who sees no meaning
          to life. I want to see many African children who are capable but lack the resources to educate themselves and become responsible citizens find away
          to change the narrative.</p>
